# 🐍 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp – Project Tracker

Welcome to my learning journey through the **[100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2024 by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)** on Udemy.

This repository is a personal tracker and portfolio of all the mini-projects and learning tasks I complete during the course. My goal is to document every step and have all my work easily accessible in one place.
